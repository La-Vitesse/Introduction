ABOUT
A community is a group of investors, users, and developers that support and supplement a particular crypto network. In an open-source ecosystem, communities are arguably the most important aspect of a project as they help create value through usage, adoption, and organic marketing.
If a protocol’s technology gives it substance, its community gives it life.

The creation of the La Vitesse is to provide a shift from the usual decentralized P2P lending strategy to a pool-based strategy. 
Redesigning the opportunity for general public taking part in yield farming of a smaller commitment yet assured returns.
Within the La Vitesse community, yield farmers (YFs) provide liquidity by depositing crypto asset in the La-Vyf contract. 
Simultaneously, the same contract will be available to the global DeFi community in the form of a pooled funds using the La-Vyf Protocol. 

La Vitesse coordinates with decentralized money market protocol where participating YFs provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income. 
Lending capital on a money market is the easiest way to earn a return in DeFi, with the entire community’s effort, every small commitment adds up to move the entire market.
